Assignment 7 Questions

1. How is the graph stored in the provided code -- adjacency matrix or edge list?
- Edge List
2. Which of the graphs are connected? How can you tell?
- All graphs but number 3 are connected. You can tell this since all of the vertices are reachable in graphs 1, 2, 4, and 5. Graph 3 is the only graph that has unreachable vertices, which means it is not connected.
3. Imagine that we ran each search in the other direction (from destination to source, instead of source to destination) -- would the output change at all? What if the graphs were directed graphs?
- If the graph is not directed then the results would be the same. However, if the graph directed we would likely see different results.
4. What are a few pros and cons of DFS vs. BFS?
- DFS can potentially take the wrong route and have to back track a long way several times.
- The opposite of the above can happen as well though, DFS could find the route very quickly if the best path is taken first.
- DFS could potentially get stuck in an infinite loop if it goes down an infinite path.
- BFS will always find the path since it is searching several paths at the same time. This prevents it from getting stuck in an infinite loop.
- BFS is not as quick as DFS since it is checking several paths at the same time.
5. What's the Big O execution time to determine if a node is reachable from another node?
- O(n)
